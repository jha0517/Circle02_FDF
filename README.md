# FDF
FDF is a project for 42 school that aims to create a wireframe rendering program using the MiniLibX library. The program reads a map file as input, which contains information about the points and lines that make up the wireframe. The program then renders the wireframe using 3D projection and allows the user to rotate and zoom in on the image.

## Getting Started

To start using FDF, you need to clone the repository from the 42 school GitLab. Once you have the source code, compile it using the make command. After compiling, you can run the program using the command `./fdf [map file]`.

## Using FDF

To use FDF, start the program by running the command `./fdf [map file]`. Replace [map file] with the path to the map file you want to render.

Once the program is running, you can use the arrow keys to rotate the image and the + and - keys to zoom in and out. You can also change the color scheme by pressing the C key.

## Features

FDF includes the following features:

- 3D wireframe color rendering
- Zooming
- Error handling
